                <p>The Spring Festival is the most important traditional festival in China. It is the day for family reunions and the day for migrant workers to return to their hometowns. Therefore, it is also the peak period for blind dates.
                </p>
                <p>Kuaishou's blind date business hopes to use this time to provide activities for singles to break the single life. As workers return to their hometowns, the activities are mainly divided by city to help people find their other half in their hometowns during the Spring Festival.
                </p>
                <p>Kuaishou's target users and the target population of this event are middle-aged people in China's third- and fourth-tier cities. The theme visual of the event needs to be centered around keywords such as "lively, eye-catching, and joyful"

            <h3>Stake Holder Diagram</h3>
            <p>Due to the existence of the two major factors of the Spring Festival and blind dates, this project involves many stakeholders.</p>
            <p>The main core of the project revolves around the company. The producers of the live streaming content are most closely related to the company, mainly live-streamers and participants. The former guides the blind date process, and the latter participates in the blind date. The interaction between the two brings entertainment. Daily activities and other Spring Festival activities are also part of the live streaming content. <br>
            <p>The outermost in the chart are the consumers of the live streaming content, mainly composed of audiences and a part of the participants. The audiences will be stimulated by the entertainment of the content and give gifts to the live-streamers and participants, while the participants will spend money to increase their blind date success rate. The remaining consumers include other blind date agencies, sponsors, and potential consumers that cooperate with the company.</p>
