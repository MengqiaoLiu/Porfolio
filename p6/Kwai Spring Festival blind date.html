                <p>The Spring Festival is the most important traditional festival in China. It is the day for family reunions and the day for migrant workers to return to their hometowns. Therefore, it is also the peak period for blind dates.
                </p>
                <p>Kuaishou's blind date business hopes to use this time to provide activities for singles to break the single life. As workers return to their hometowns, the activities are mainly divided by city to help people find their other half in their hometowns during the Spring Festival.
                </p>
                <p>Kuaishou's target users and the target population of this event are middle-aged people in China's third- and fourth-tier cities. The theme visual of the event needs to be centered around keywords such as "lively, eye-catching, and joyful"
