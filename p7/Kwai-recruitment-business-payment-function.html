            <h3>Problems</h3>
            <p>China's blue-collar job market is vast, with companies urgently needing to recruit large numbers of workers. However, blue-collar job seekers have limited access to information channels, making it difficult for them to find jobs outside of their personal networks. 
            <strong>Kuaishou offers live-streaming recruitment sessions to help companies showcase their work environment and benefits.</strong> However, due to a lack of experience in live streaming, companies often fail to meet their recruitment needs. 
            <strong>Some companies have started to hire professional influencers</strong> to conduct recruitment on their behalf, paying a commission fee. While this approach is effective, it raises concerns about transaction security.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, recruiters and influencers need 
                <strong>Kuaishou as a third-party platform to help meet their needs and ensure secure transactions. </strong></p>
        </section>
        <section class="content-section">

                <div class="content-item">
                    <p>1. Job seekers often 
                        <strong>lack the skills to efficiently search for and filter information online,</strong> and learning new job search software presents a high barrier for them.</p>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <p>2. Companies using their own accounts for recruitment often have few initial followers, resulting in low traffic. Additionally, 
                        <strong>internal staff may lack the expertise to effectively promote through live streaming.</strong></p>

                    <p>3. The lack of a third-party regulator in collaborations between companies and influencers leads to unsecured transactions and increases the risk of contract breaches, poor service, and disputes.</p>

            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>We have taken this opportunity to create the Kuaishou Recruitment Platform Payment Feature: a platform that helps recruiters and influencers 
                <strong>establish transaction rules and conduct secure transactions.</strong> This feature aims to help companies enhance their exposure and achieve recruitment goals, expand income channels for influencers, and make it easier for job seekers to find employment.

                    <p><strong>1. Simplifying the connection between job seekers and companies.</strong><br>
                        By introducing the concept of e-commerce into live-streaming recruitment, 
                        <strong>job positions are treated as products,</strong> and each resume submission is equivalent to a purchase order. When companies set up recruitment positions, they need to establish a price for each resume.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Standardizing the collaboration between companies and influencers, ensuring the security of commission payments and service quality.</strong>
                        A wallet feature is implemented where recruiters must deposit funds to cover recruitment expenses. Once a recruitment position is set and published, the corresponding funds are frozen on the Kuaishou platform to ensure the recruiter has the necessary funds and will not default.</p>

                        A recruitment backend is set up where recruiters can monitor recruitment results in real-time and perform various actions on the positions (such as terminating the recruitment, updating job requirements, or increasing the number of positions).</p>
